            <p>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is a medical procedure designed to assist individuals or couples experiencing fertility issues in having a baby. The process involves stimulating the ovaries to produce multiple eggs, retrieving mature eggs through
                a minor surgical procedure, fertilizing the eggs with sperm in a laboratory dish, culturing the embryos for a few days, and then transferring one or more healthy embryos into the woman's uterus. Hormonal support may be provided to enhance
                the chances of successful implantation. A pregnancy test is conducted later to determine if the procedure was successful. IVF may incorporate additional techniques such as genetic testing or the use of donor eggs or sperm. While IVF has
                helped many couples achieve pregnancy, its success is not guaranteed and can vary based on individual factors.</p>
